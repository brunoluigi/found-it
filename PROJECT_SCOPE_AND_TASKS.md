## Project Scope

### Key Objectives
- Develop an intuitive platform for users to register and manage their items
- Enable generation of PDF with printable tags containing QR codes and essential item info
- Allow finders to easily report found items by scanning the QR code
- Ensure privacy and security of user and item data
